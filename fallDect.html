              <p>Fall detection in wearable wristbands for the elderly operates through the integration of an accelerometer, a device that measures the acceleration forces acting on it. When a person wears such a wristband, the accelerometer continuously monitors the wearer's movements, distinguishing between normal activities and a potential fall. In the event of a fall, the accelerometer detects a sudden change in movement and orientation, characterized by a rapid acceleration followed by a sudden stop. This pattern is indicative of a fall, differentiating it from regular daily activities.</p>
    
              <p>Once the wristband identifies this specific pattern, it triggers an alert system. This system is designed to send a signal through Bluetooth to a pre-set phone number or medical alert service. This immediate notification ensures that the wearer can receive prompt assistance, potentially reducing the risk of severe injuries or complications that can arise from prolonged periods of immobility after a fall. This technology provides a layer of safety and peace of mind for both the elderly and their caregivers, offering a proactive approach to fall prevention and response.</p>
